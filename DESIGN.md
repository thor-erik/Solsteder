# Solsteder Design System

One source of truth for visual language. Before making UI changes — manually or with AI tools — start here. If a change wants to break a rule in this doc, update the doc first and justify the change in the commit message.

## Principles

1. **Subtraction beats addition.** When hierarchy feels off, remove elements before adding them. Most "it doesn't pop" problems are noise problems, not emphasis problems.
2. **Color carries meaning; don't waste it on decoration.** Every color token has one job. Using `--accent` for "this looks nice here" is how design drift starts.
3. **Weather data and UI chrome use separate palettes.** Never overlap them. Orange accent is never a weather color; amber sun is never a UI color.
4. **No more than three type scales visible in one composition.** If a panel shows five different text sizes, it's cluttered regardless of the content.

## Color tokens

### Brand / UI chrome

| Token | Value | Used for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `--bg` | `#111E38` | App background behind all panels |
| `--text` | `#FFF2EB` | Primary text, thumb line, scrubber handles |
| `--muted` | `#9CBDE7` | Secondary text, inactive icons, axis labels, dividers |
| `--accent` | `#FFAF85` | Interactive state ONLY: selected value, primary CTA text, focused readout time. Never decorative, never a background fill on non-interactive elements. |
| `--accent-dim` | `rgba(255,175,133,0.15)` | Subtle selected backgrounds, accent glow rings |
| `--accent-on` | `#2a1a0c` | Text color drawn ON an `--accent` background (e.g. selected button label). Not for use elsewhere. |

Never use `#FFFFFF` or `rgba(255,255,255,1)` for text or interactive fills. Use `--text` for warmth and consistency. Pure-white glows (`box-shadow … rgba(255,255,255,...)`) are also off-system — use `rgba(156,189,231,0.3)` instead.

### Glass surfaces (three levels — don't invent more)

| Level | Background | Blur | Use |
|-------|------------|------|-----|
| panel | `rgba(20,46,82,0.55)` | `16px` | List peek, detail panel, readout panel |
| card | `rgba(20,46,82,0.50)` | `12px` | Content cards inside panels |
| action | `rgba(20,46,82,0.45)` | `10px` | Buttons, pills, chips, small controls |

Border for all glass: `1px solid rgba(156,189,231,0.18)`.

No other background/blur combinations should be introduced. Map controls, overlays, and floating buttons all use one of these three levels. `rgba(14,26,52,...)` and `rgba(10,20,42,...)` are legacy values that should be migrated.

### Weather data ramp (USE ONLY for forecast visualizations)

A single perceptual axis from full sun to no light. Do not split into categorical hues. Partly-sunny is a *position on this ramp*, not a third color.

| State | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| full sun | `#FFD488` | 80–100% sun availability |
| partly sunny | `#E6C08A` | 40–80% sun availability |
| overcast | `#8EA0B8` | 0–40%, no precipitation |
| rain | `#5E7CA8` | precipitation |
| night | `#1C2B4A` | before sunrise / after sunset |

**Scope:** use these colors only for direct forecast data visualization — the time bar segments, temperature curves, precipitation overlays, and similar data-ink. Venue-level sun status (score badges, availability labels, "steder i solen" count) uses `--accent`, not this ramp — those indicate a UI state, not a weather measurement.

Rule: weather colors never touch UI chrome and `--accent` never touches forecast data. If you need to indicate "this weather segment is currently selected," don't recolor the segment — use the thumb.

## Typography

Font: Inter (already loaded in `index.html`).

| Role | Size | Weight | Color | Use |
|------|------|--------|-------|-----|
| Display | 24–28pt | 700 | `--accent` (selected/focused value) or `--text` (informational numbers) | Readout time, primary numbers |
| Title | 17–18pt | 600 | `--text` | Venue names, panel headers |
| Body | 14pt | 500 | `--text` | Standard text |
| Meta | 12–13pt | 500 | `--muted` | Stats, secondary info, sub-lines |
| Caption | 10–11pt | 500 | `--muted` | Axis labels, tiny hints |

**Display color rule:** use `--accent` when the value is the direct answer to what the user just picked (e.g. currently-selected time). Use `--text` for computed or contextual numbers (temperatures, distances, counts). Do not use `--accent` for decorative large text.

Never use sub-9pt text outside of calendar tile labels — those are a special case, not a precedent.

## Motion

No undocumented animation durations. Use these values:

| Token | Duration | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `--transition-fast` | `120ms` | Hover state changes, color flips |
| `--transition-base` | `220ms` | Panel slides, dropdowns, focus rings |
| `--transition-slow` | `400ms` | Intro reveals, large layout transitions |

Cross-fade on readout numeric updates: 100ms total (50ms fade-out, text swap, 50ms fade-in). This is the ceiling — do not add more animation to a value that updates on every scrub tick.

## Elevation (box-shadow)

Three levels, matching glass surfaces. No other shadow values.

| Level | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| low | `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)` | Cards, small controls |
| mid | `0 6px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.50)` | Floating panels, dropdowns |
| high | `0 12px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.60)` | Modals, prominent overlays |

## Components

### Buttons — two flavors only

**Action pill** (labeled)
- Background: glass-action level
- Padding: `0 14px`, min-height `56px`
- Radius: `16px`
- Text: 13pt / 600 / `--text`
- Icon (optional): 16px, `--muted` opacity 0.85

**Action circle** (icon-only)
- Size: `44×44px`, circular (not 34px — that fails touch targets)
- Background: glass-action level
- Icon: 20px, `--accent` for primary actions (Locate Me) or `--muted` for chrome

Selected state for either: background `--accent`, text `--accent-on` (`#2a1a0c`), border transparent.

### Time bar (primary input)

- Height: `44–56px`
- Segments: **hour granularity only.** No sub-hour ticks. Dividers between hours: `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15)` or omitted entirely.
- Segment fill: from weather ramp above.
- Optional weather glyph: centered in segment, 10–12px, `--muted`. Drop the glyphs if segments are narrower than 24px.
- Scrub is continuous; snap the **display text only** to 15-minute increments. The underlying `timeFromEl.value` and thumb position remain continuous — do not snap the thumb.

### Thumb (time bar)

- Vertical line: 2px wide, `--text` color, extends 4px above and below the bar.
- Circle cap: 10px diameter, `--text`, sits on top edge of bar.
- **No text inside the thumb.** Selected time lives in the readout.
- **Do not use `--accent`** on the thumb — it collides with full-sun segments.

### "NÅ" tick

Thin dashed vertical line (`1px dashed --muted`), full height of bar. Tiny `NÅ` label above, 9pt / 700 / `--muted`, letter-spacing 0.5px.

### Readout panel (answers "what did I pick?")

- Docked ~8px above the time bar, matching width and border radius (so they read as one control group).
- Glass-panel level background, `16px` blur.
- Three-tier hierarchy:
  - **Tier 1** — selected time: 24pt, 700, `--accent`. Dominant.
  - **Tier 2** — sun result ("78 steder i solen"): 14pt, 500, `--text`. Secondary line.
  - **Tier 3** — weather metadata (`⛅ 10° ↘ 2 m/s`): 12pt, 500, `--muted`. Right-aligned on the same line as the time.
- Do not show the date here — it lives on the date pill.
- Hue-shift (optional): during scrub, the panel's background tints toward the weather ramp color at the current thumb position, max 10–15% saturation, 120ms ease-out. Easy to overdo; stay subtle.

### Date pill

- Action pill flavor, with calendar icon + label.
- Always shows the selected date in readable form (e.g. `Lør 25 Apr`). Never reduce to icon-only — users should see the date at a glance.

## Don't

- Don't use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or pure-white glows for interactive elements or text. Use `--text` (`#FFF2EB`).
- Don't add new color tokens without documenting them here first.
- Don't encode weather with brand colors or vice versa.
- Don't use more than three type scales in one composition.
- Don't use sub-hour segmentation on the time bar. Scrub continuously, paint discretely.
- Don't duplicate information across adjacent elements (e.g., date in both the readout and the date pill).
- Don't animate on every value change. Rapid scrubs turn into visual noise. A 100ms cross-fade on numeric updates is the ceiling.
- Don't introduce glass surface variants outside the three documented levels. If the existing levels don't fit, update this document.
- Don't create shadow values ad hoc. Use the three documented elevation levels.
